# Inferno

Our Vision is to minimize the risks of Machine Learning and unlock its full power through frameworks
that ensure the ethical and conscious development of ML projects across all industries.

Project Inferno is an initiative that aims to further the field of Machine Learning Security by
identifying common threats in the Machine Learning lifecycle. This project
includes a set of practical hands-on examples for these threats, as well as the
recommended practices to mitigate them.
